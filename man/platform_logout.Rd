\title{Logout from MSAID Platform}
\usage{
platform_logout()
}
\value{
NULL (invisible). The function does not return a value but prints 
  "Logout was successful" to confirm the logout operation.
}
\description{
Clears all stored authentication tokens and resets the internal environment state,
effectively logging the user out from the MSAID Platform. After calling this function,
you will need to call \code{\link{platform_login}} again to authenticate before
accessing any platform resources.
}
\details{
This function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
  \item Clears stored ID tokens used for API authentication
  \item Clears stored refresh tokens used for automatic token renewal
  \item Resets all internal environment variables to their default state
  \item Does not clear the local experiment data cache (use \code{\link{platform_clear_experiment_cache}} for that)
}
}
\note{
This function only clears local tokens and does not invalidate tokens on the server side.
  For complete security, especially on shared machines, consider also clearing your browser's
  authentication cookies for the MSAID Platform.
