\title{Read Experiment Results Summary}
\usage{
platform_read_experiment_results_summary(
  experiment_names = c(),
  experiment_uuids = c()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiment_names}{Character vector or single string. Names of the experiments to retrieve summaries for.
Can be a single experiment name (string) or multiple names (character vector). Default is empty vector c().}

\item{experiment_uuids}{Character vector. UUIDs of experiments to retrieve summaries for.
Can be used as an alternative to or in combination with experiment_names when you know the specific experiment UUIDs.
Default is empty vector c().}
}
\value{
A data frame containing summary statistics for the requested experiments.
  Each row represents one experiment with columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{experiment_uuid} - UUID of the experiment
    \item \code{experiment_name} - Name of the experiment (only included when experiment names were provided as input)
    \item \code{psms_count} - Number of peptide-spectrum matches
    \item \code{peptides_count} - Number of peptides
    \item \code{protein_groups_count} - Number of protein groups
    \item \code{precursors_count} - Number of precursors
  }
}
\description{
Retrieves summary statistics for one or more experiments from the MSAID Platform.
Returns a data frame containing counts of PSMs, peptides, protein groups, and precursors
for each experiment. This provides a quick overview of experiment results without
downloading the full datasets.
}
\details{
This function provides a lightweight way to get overview statistics for experiments
without downloading full result datasets. It's useful for:
\itemize{
  \item Quickly assessing experiment completion and result sizes
  \item Comparing result counts across multiple experiments
  \item Validating experiment processing before downloading full data
  \item Monitoring experiment progress and data quality
}

The function accepts both experiment names and UUIDs. If both are provided, all specified
experiments will be included in the results. Experiment names are resolved to UUIDs
internally using the platform's experiment listing API.

\strong{Count Filtering Criteria:}
The counts returned by this function are filtered as follows:
\itemize{
  \item \code{psms_count} - PSMs with file local FDR < 0.01
  \item \code{precursors_count} - Precursors with dataset global FDR < 0.01
  \item \code{peptides_count} - Peptides with dataset global FDR < 0.01
  \item \code{protein_groups_count} - Protein groups with dataset global FDR < 0.01
}
}

# Get summary for a single experiment by name
